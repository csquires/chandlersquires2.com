abstract: Consider the problem of determining the effect of a drug on a specific cell type. To answer this question, researchers traditionally need to run an experiment applying the drug of interest to that cell type. This approach is not scalable - given a large number of different actions (drugs) and a large number of different contexts (cell types), it is infeasible to run an experiment for every action-context pair. In such cases, one would ideally like to predict the result for every pair while only having to perform experiments on a small subset of pairs. This task, which we label "causal imputation", is a generalization of the causal transportability problem. In this paper, we provide two main contributions. First, we demonstrate the efficacy of the recently introduced *synthetic interventions* estimator on the task of causal imputation when applied to the prominent CMAP dataset. Second, we explain the demonstrated success of this estimator by introducing a generic *linear structural causal model* which accounts for the interaction between cell type and drug.
