In September 2024, I am starting as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at CMU, supervised by 
{{< myshortcode "https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/" >}}Pradeep Ravikumar.{{< /myshortcode >}}
Previously, I was a PhD Student at MIT, where I was advised by 
{{< myshortcode "https://www.carolineuhler.com" >}}Caroline Uhler{{< /myshortcode >}} 
and
{{< myshortcode "https://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/" >}}David Sontag.{{< /myshortcode >}}

I think of myself as working on the foundations of **Pragmatic Data Science**, a framework for statistical analysis that emphasizes downstream decision-making. 
My research touches on several topics in causality (***causal effect estimation***, ***causal structure learning***, and ***causal representation learning***) and combines tools from high-dimensional statistics, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning. 

On the application side, I am broadly interested in AI4Science and the unique challenges encountered when bringing AI into scientific domains. Right now, I am focused on applications of my work in drug discovery and cellular biology.

**Teaching and Service.**
I developed and taught a seven-lecture course on causality for MIT's 2023 January term, check out the 
{{< myshortcode "https://github.com/csquires/6.S091-causality" >}}lecture notes{{< /myshortcode >}} 
and
{{< myshortcode "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiyH4sDpByicWHWv-xaI4gRbxrpFv2-FA" >}}recordings.{{< /myshortcode >}}
<!--  -->
I co-organize the 
{{< myshortcode "https://portal.valencelabs.com/care" >}}Causality, Abstraction, Reasoning, and Extrapolation (CARE){{< /myshortcode >}}
talk series, and I am serving as Publication Chair for 
{{< myshortcode "https://www.cclear.cc/2025" >}}CLeaR 2025.{{< /myshortcode >}}
<!--  -->
During my PhD, I was a member of the 
{{< myshortcode "https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/" >}}EECS Communication Lab,{{< /myshortcode >}} 
where I coached researchers on technical communication tasks such as paper writing, poster design, and oral presentation.

**Software.** During my PhD, I developed and maintained 
{{< myshortcode "https://github.com/uhlerlab/causaldag" >}}causaldag,{{< /myshortcode >}}
a Python package for creating, manipulating, and learning causal graphical models.

**Other materials.** I try to keep an up-to-date repository of {{< myshortcode "https://github.com/uhlerlab/causaldag" >}}slides{{< /myshortcode >}} from my talks and {{< myshortcode "https://github.com/csquires/chandler-squires-posters" >}}posters{{< /myshortcode >}} from conferences and workshops.
